  * ## **Design**
    * **Color Scheme**
        * The color scheme i have chosen was generated by canva color generator, by adding the home page background into the generator.  
          The image below shows the results generated.  
    
            ![image of color scheme](/readme/images/new-color-scheme.png)             
    
    
    * **Typography**
        * The first font i chose was **Orbitiron** with a fall back of **San-Serif**. I used this font for the company logo and all navigation elements including buttons throughout the site.  
        The reason behind my choice is that it suited the overall theme of the site i was aiming to achieve. **Orbitron** looks at home in a video-game or sci-fi setting which was perfect for my website.  
        
        * The second font i chose was **Saira Extra Condensed** with a fall back of **San-Serif** which was used for all sub-headings & paragraphs throughout the website.  
        The reason i chose this font was again its overall look suited the video-game/Sci-fi look i was trying to achieve, i choose to increase the **letter spacing**  
        as the default setting was a little to tight and visually was quite difficult to read.

        * Lastly i decided to use the browser default font **Times-New-Roman** for the quote and list item elements with every intention of changing it as development progressed.  
        However i decided that **Times-New-Roman** worked well with the other 2 fonts chosen so decided to keep it. its a Clean and simple font that is easy to read. 

    * **Imagery**
        * The first image i chose was the neon background that would be central to all of the pages throughout the site, this was also the image used to develop  
        the colour scheme as this would provide a consistent look and style on every page.  
        The 3 images on the home page were chosen to show the user what we have to offer, Video-games, Cocktails and a fun atmosphere it was important to me that  
        the images fit in with the colour scheme so were chosen based on their colour composition.

        * Images for the activities page were chosen under the same rules as the home page images, they had to match the colour scheme and overall look of the website.  
        This decision did cause a few issues, Priamrily the text being hard to read when placed over the card images so i added a text underlay to dull the image.  
        Again i chose 4 images that were and exciting backdrop to the text with the intent of stimulating the users interest.

        * Other images used include a background for the 404 error page and a coming soon image for the rooms page. both of these images were again chosen to match the  
        colour scheme that i had chosen.

## **Credits**
---
  * ## **Code**
       * I Have not used any code snippets from external sources, all code was written by my hand. I did extensive research on how to use  
       **transition** effects on elements through css and applied these myself. i did re-purpose the **_bootstrap_** font size calculator and applied it to other elements on my website.  
       **Example Below:**
    ```css
       .activities-card-lead {
        font-size: calc(1.4rem + .9vw);
        word-spacing: calc(.25rem + .9vw); 
    }
    ```

    * I'd like to thank Bristol college for supporting me throughout this project. I've had to cope with severe illness & a baby arrival during my work  
    on this project and the support i have received has really helped me through this experience.

    * I'd also like to thank my fellow students on **_slack_** who were always quick to help me with any issues i may have had.

    * I'd also like to thank my mentor, although our contact has been minimal due to life issues, she really put me at ease and made me feel welcome.

    * Finally i'd like to thank my wife and my older son for putting up with the emotional roller coaster the last few months have been, without their love and support  i wouldnt have got to where i am now.
